      <p class="subtitle">The intersection of Disney and UX and why learning how to draw Mickey Mouse will change how you approach design.</p>

      <p>Before I became a UX designer, I thought I wanted to be a title sequence designer. I took a course at Carnegie Mellon taught by Dan Boyarski called Time, Motion, and Communication. It was all about kinetic typography, rhythm, color, and movement. Dan used to describe every element on screen as if it were an actor on a stage — a character that we were directing, giving it behavior and personality.</p>

      <p><i>“You are responsible for directing each element’s entrance, performance, and exit.”</i></p>

      <p><b>Modi sed neque ipsa cum est consectetur necessitatibus, delectus tenetur nihil.</b></p>

      <p>We would constantly revisit this <a href="">sequence</a>, giving reason to why a character was there and what its role was. Introducing time and motion changed everything for me, because what I realized was that it gave you precise control over the emotion you are trying to convey and how an audience will interpret your message. I’d often look to title sequences for inspiration because I was fascinated with how a 30 second or 3 minute sequence had the ability to set the tone for an entire film and foreshadow what was going to happen. When the job hunt began, it was a happy accident how I ended up as a UX designer at R/GA. I knew R/GA had a history in title sequence design — had no idea if they still did that now — but knew it was a place I wanted to work. I intended to apply for a visual design position but was nudged into UX, so started day one thinking, “what are wireframes?!”</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A strong company culture, which is difficult to create but makes people go the extra mile, when they really need to.</li>
          <li>A strong CFO/accountant/accounting system keeps the tax man away, along with unpleasant surprises.</li>
          <li>A strong contract-management tool and/or lawyer. Nothing can kill an SME so quickly as unsigned deals, ownership agreements, investor papers, etc.</li>
          <li>A strong board, who are more experienced than you but still open-minded.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>I often tell people to think of this the same way we treat copy guidelines. Every project where we think about, “If a brand were to speak to us, what would it say?” we also need to start thinking, “If a brand were to move, what would it feel like?” Is it whimsical? Is it swift and powerful? Is it a subtle added detail that helps users recognize who exactly you are? Demonstrating your tone of voice leaves your users with these little moments where they feel like saying, “I could totally see this brand doing that” because it felt so right and appropriate.</p>
